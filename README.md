# Reward Models Inherit Value Biases from Pretraining

This repository contains code and data for analyzing how reward models trained on different base models (Gemma vs. Llama) inherit value-related biases from their pretrained representations. We evaluate this using two established psychological instruments — the Big Two personality framework (Agency/Communion) and the Moral Foundations Dictionary 2.0 — by examining how 10 off-the-shelf reward models from RewardBench rank value-laden tokens, by tracing these these biases back to their pretrained base-models and the "implicit" RMs between them, and by tracking how these biases emerge during reward model training.

## Reproducing Figures

All scripts assume the working directory is the repository root.

### Figure 1 — Off-the-shelf reward model rankings (Big Two & MFD)

```bash
Rscript figures/generate_figure_1_and_A1.R
```

Produces in `figures/output/`:
- `fig1a_big2.pdf` — Figure 1(a) (Big Two, mean + SE)
- `fig1b_mfd.pdf` — Figure 1(b) (MFD, mean + SE)
- `figA1a_big2.pdf` — Figure A1(a) (Big Two, individual models + SD)
- `figA1b_mfd.pdf` — Figure A1(b) (MFD, individual models + SD)

### Figure 2 — Base-model log-probability comparison

```bash
python figures/logprob_model_comparison.py
```

Requires GPU and HuggingFace access to download Gemma 2 2B and Llama 3.2 3B. Produces in `figures/output/`:
- `big2_logprob_rank_gemma_vs_llamma_pretrained.png` — Figure 2b
- `big2_logprob_rank_gemma_vs_llamma_instruct.png` — Figure 2a

### Figure 3 — MWLR lollipop plot (Freedom vs Love)

```bash
python figures/generate_figure_3.py
```

Uses precomputed logprobs in `data/logprobs/`. Produces in `figures/output/`:
- `fig3_lollipop.pdf` — Lollipop plot of MWLR scores across Llama × Gemma 2 model pairs

### Figure 4 — RM training checkpoints and ablation

```bash
Rscript figures/generate_figure_4.R
```

Requires the parquet checkpoint data in `data/reward_model_training/`. Produces in `figures/output/`:
- `fig4a_training_checkpoints.pdf` — Figure 4(a) (median rank over training steps)
- `fig4b_ablations.pdf` — Figure 4(b) (data source and quantity ablations)

## Data Provenance

- **Reward model scores** (`data/reward_model_scores/`): Generated by scoring dictionary tokens with 10 reward models from the [RewardBench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench) leaderboard, spanning Gemma-based and Llama-based architectures (Skywork-Reward, ArmoRM, GRM, QRM, URM).
- **Value dictionaries** (`data/corpora/`): The Big Two (Agency/Communion) dictionary is from Abele et al.; the Moral Foundations Dictionary 2.0 is from Frimer et al.
- **Training data** (`data/reward_model_training/`): Checkpoint-level reward rankings from in-house training runs using Bradley–Terry and generative reward modeling objectives on UltraFeedback, Skywork, and GRM preference datasets at varying scales (13K–550K pairs).
- **MWLR logprobs** (`data/logprobs/`): Token-level log-probabilities from 7 Llama 3–3.3 (1B–70B) and 3 Gemma 2 (2B–27B) instruction-tuned models, elicited with the prompt "What, in one word, is the greatest thing ever?" Used to compute mixture-weighted log-ratio (MWLR) scores for Figure 3.
