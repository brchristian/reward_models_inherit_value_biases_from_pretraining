# Reward Models Inherit Value Biases from Pretraining

This repository contains code and data for analyzing how reward models trained on different base models (Gemma vs. Llama) inherit value-related biases from their pretrained representations. We evaluate this using two established psychological instruments — the Big Two personality framework (Agency/Communion) and the Moral Foundations Dictionary 2.0 — by examining how 10 off-the-shelf reward models from RewardBench rank value-laden tokens, by tracing these these biases back to their pretrained base-models and the "implicit" RMs between them, and by tracking how these biases emerge during reward model training.

## Requirements

### R

Used by `generate_figure_1.R` and `generate_figure_4.R`.

```r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse", "tidytext", "ggpubr", "ggbeeswarm",
  "extrafont", "nlme", "MKinfer",
  "jsonlite", "fuzzyjoin", "arrow"
))
```

### Python

Used by `logprob_model_comparison.py`. Requires a CUDA-capable GPU.

```
numpy
pandas
torch
transformers
huggingface_hub
seaborn
matplotlib
statsmodels
```

## Reproducing Figures

All scripts assume the working directory is the repository root.

### Figure 1 — Off-the-shelf reward model rankings

```bash
Rscript figures/generate_figure_1.R
```

Produces four PDFs in `figures/output/`:
- `fig1a_big2_main.pdf` / `fig1a_big2_supplement.pdf`
- `fig1b_mfd_main.pdf` / `fig1b_mfd_supplement.pdf`

### Figure 4 — Training checkpoints and ablation

```bash
Rscript figures/generate_figure_4.R
```

Requires the parquet checkpoint data in `data/reward_model_training/`.

### Base-model log-probability comparison

```bash
python figures/logprob_model_comparison.py
```

Requires GPU and HuggingFace access to download Gemma 2 2B and Llama 3.2 3B. Outputs PNG plots to `figures/output/`.

## Data Provenance

- **Reward model scores** (`data/reward_model_scores/`): Generated by scoring dictionary tokens with 10 reward models from the [RewardBench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench) leaderboard, spanning Gemma-based and Llama-based architectures (Skywork-Reward, ArmoRM, GRM, QRM, URM).
- **Value dictionaries** (`data/corpora/`): The Big Two (Agency/Communion) dictionary is from Abele et al.; the Moral Foundations Dictionary 2.0 is from Frimer et al.
- **Training data** (`data/reward_model_training/`): Checkpoint-level reward rankings from in-house training runs using Bradley–Terry and generative reward modeling objectives on UltraFeedback, Skywork, and GRM preference datasets at varying scales (13K–550K pairs).
